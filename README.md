Mostly free resources for learning how to hack. 

They're in chronological order of when I first started using them, as best as I can remember. 

Sometimes I run into a roadblock, a concept that's too advanced for me. Learning cryptography on cryptopals.com so I could solve a hacker101 ctf is an example. I just put the resource away and move on to a new one. One day I'll get back to finishing those ctfs. 

Google is your rabbit hole. Let curiosity be your spark. That first resource is all you need to know, your trailhead. The rest of the journey will come to you. 

This is true not just for finding resources but for completing labs as well. Sure, use hints if you're stuck. Get to the answer. But then go back and understand why it works. Or why the method you tried earlier didn't work. Learn for yourself and be thorough in your learning, it may serve you later. 

1. [Portswigger's academy: portswigger.net/web-security](https://portswigger.net/web-security) - discovered in July when I started learning hacking, specifically web app bug bounties which I'll refer to as just bug bounties. 
2. NetworkChuck on youtube - I still watch him, he teaches networks as he's a network engineer, now he's getting more into hacking. His TCP stuff made the CompTIA A+ book smoother learning for me. 
3. St√∂k on youtube - his stuff came in handy during portswigger's academy, like using the devtools as an alternative to burp repeater. And he was interviewed by NetworkChuck. 
4. [OWASP top 10 sec risks: owasp.org/www-project-top-ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) - just skim through it, get the names down
5. [Tryhackme's room on it: tryhackme.com/room/owasptop10](https://tryhackme.com/room/owasptop10) - didn't do it but it should supplement what you already learned on portswigger
6. HackerOne on youtube - I just watch the interviews, they're a source of inspiration. To hear these top guys's stories, to see them hanging out with other grandmasters, it's amazing. Know your gods. 
7. [THM's complete beginner path: tryhackme.com/path/outline/beginner](https://tryhackme.com/path/outline/beginner) - when I first learned systems pentesting which I'll refer to as just pentesting. It's now deprecated because they've replaced it with the Junior Pentester path released October 2021 but it's still relevant and made the Jr path smoother learning. 
8. [Hackerone's ctf: ctf.hacker101.com](https://ctf.hacker101.com) - I got through the first few up until cryptography
9. Hackerone's playlists: [www.hacker101.com/playlists/web_hacking](https://www.hacker101.com/playlists/web_hacking), [www.hacker101.com/playlists/pentesting_series](https://www.hacker101.com/playlists/pentesting_series), and [www.hacker101.com/playlists/mobile_hacking](https://www.hacker101.com/playlists/mobile_hacking) - actually have not tried because I just discovered it but it fits right in here
10. David Bombal on Youtube
11. [THM: tryhackme.com](https://tryhackme.com) - we talked about the Beginner path. The Junior path is great because after completing it I finally understood what I'm looking at when I see an IP address given to me on hackthebox. Sqli and burp which I learned in step 1 are now to me just tools to help me get a reverse shell. I'm a pentester now. As of February I'm doing the Offensive path. 
12. VMware - how I run kali linux. I use the pro version but it should work with the free version.
13. Kali - NetworkChuck taught me a bit about it in the beginning but I didn't start learning it until the Junior thm path, in which I learned everything about kali by using it in solving labs. But then OpenVPN started giving me shit so at this point I use the attackboxes, but that's fine now that I already know kali. Learn your tools first, then use what's more efficient, faster. 
14. [ExploitDB: exploit-db.com](https://exploit-db.com) - like Kali you will learn this in tryhackme's Jr path, along with searchsploit and while we're at it, metasploit, msfvenom, meterpreter, pentestmonkey's blog with the php-reverse-shell, github search... Seriously, thm gives you a good foundation.
15. Mike Meyer's CompTIA A+ book - I'm getting that cert and becoming a tech support so I can fund my hacking studies and use tech support to move into cyber security, working as a pentester hirable on Linkedin... otherwise I have to go the college route and I can't afford it, nor do I have scholarships because I'm a high school dropout with a GED :)
16. [Meyer's supplementary course udemy.com/course/new-comptia-a-2019-certification-1001-the-total-course](https://www.udemy.com/course/new-comptia-a-2019-certification-1001-the-total-course/) - I bought it during a sale, look out for those
17. John Hammond on Youtube - learn how he solves ctfs, speedruns through linux. He's also in everyone's discord server. Just don't get lost staring at his face when he's teaching you eternalblue. 
18. Speaking of discord: https://discord.com/invite/tryhackme
19. [Vulnhub: vulnhub.com](https://vulnhub.com) - After completing the Jr path I finally did my first box, hackme 1. 
20. [HTB: hackthebox.eu](https://hackthebox.eu) - vulnerable boxes in the cloud, also uses OpenVPN. And it looks like they have courses, I haven't tried yet but check them out before going into tryhackme.
